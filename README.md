Hello everyone, this is my first repo. My code is a little different with the official one. My env is:
> python==3.8.12,  pytorch==1.7.0, cudatoolkit==10.2 

I can't upload the dataset(Fashion MNIST)due to its size,the BaiduYun link is:(available permanently)
> https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pEvcfXlkrI0EL5VYiVUwuA 
> 
> code:7470

You should put the datasets in the root dir, like:
> Dive_into_DL/datasets

**I will appreciate it if you can point out bugs or come up with issues of my code**
